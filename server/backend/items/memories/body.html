    Memories is an interactive experience, written in WebGL and Javascript.

    As the power of Rendering engines at the time (2014) was underwhelming, memories

    use a combination of GPU and CPU rendering.

    <em>Shaders</em> are used in order to render the Model, Flare, Clouds, Lighting as well as post-processing

    effects such as the edge blur.

    <em>Traditional JavaScript</em> is used to animate the model, pull pictures out of facebook

    and render them into the canvas.
